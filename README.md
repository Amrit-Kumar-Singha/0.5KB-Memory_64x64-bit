# Designing a 64x64 Bit 0.5KB RAM Using Cadence Genus and Innovus

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of both the synthesis and physical design processes involved in memory design. üöÄ

## Project Overview
The aim was to design a 64x64 bit RAM, a fundamental component in many digital systems. This 0.5KB memory design encompassed various stages, from coding in Verilog to physical implementation and verification using industry-standard tools.

## Steps Involved

### üñ•Ô∏è Verilog Design
- Created a Verilog module for the 64x64 bit RAM, focusing on efficient memory operations.

### üîß Synthesis with Genus
- Utilized Cadence Genus to synthesize the Verilog code into a gate-level netlist.
- Addressed constraints and optimized the design for performance and area.

### üèóÔ∏è Place-and-Route with Innovus
- Imported the synthesized netlist into Cadence Innovus for physical design.
- Performed floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing.
- Ensured the design met all timing, area, and power specifications.

## Highlights
- Overcame challenges related to design constraints and optimization.
- Generated detailed reports for area, gate count, power, and timing.
- Achieved a functional and verified physical layout, ready for fabrication.

## Visuals
Here are some screenshots from the Innovus tool, showcasing the layout and routing of the 64x64 bit RAM.
